WARNING: [XFORM 203-104] Completely partitioning array 'pn_seq.V'  accessed through non-constant indices on dimension 1 (correlator.cpp:368:30), which may result in long runtime and suboptimal QoR due to large multiplexers. Please consider wrapping the array access into a function or using a register file core instead.
